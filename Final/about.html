            Life is the aspect of existence that processes, acts, reacts, evaluates, and evolves through growth.
        </p>

            For some people, the purpose of life may be to make the world a better place. Others may believe that the point of life is to find and achieve personal fulfillment.
             And some may feel that the point of life is simply to enjoy it as much as possible.
